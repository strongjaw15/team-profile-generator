## Description

This app lets the user, in a node environment, use the command-line to create basic profiles for members of a work team, and then creates an html page displaying cards for each team member. I wanted to build this app so that I could quickly put together all the information for people working together on a project, and then have a succinct, visual layout of those members, their roles, and their pertinent information. Now that I have this app, I don't have to write a new webpage each time a team is formed. I can quickly build it here.

I learned a lot about using classes in object oriented pprogramming while making this app, and also learned how to write tests for my code.
